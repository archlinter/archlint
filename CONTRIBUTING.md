## Contributions

archlint is an opinionated tool with a strong architectural philosophy.
The core vision and design decisions are maintained by the author.

Contributions are welcome, especially:
- new detectors for real-world architectural problems
- improvements to existing detectors or presets
- documentation and real usage examples

Before starting work on large changes, please open an issue to discuss the approach.
PRs should be small, focused, and aligned with the project's philosophy
("ratchet, don’t renovate").

The maintainer reserves the right to decline changes
that don’t fit the long-term direction of the project.
